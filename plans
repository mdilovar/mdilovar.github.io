done so far (current commit):
// tidied up the code after the feature_mouse_rotation merging // used beautify // removed keyboard controls // removed EventControls lib // removed many now obsolete Cube functions (those referring to specific layers)

current task:


next up:
- css size make more responsive - on prof pc stuff was small (did some changes still more needed?). "HS" -> best time?
- during scrambling tell user to wait
- issue: scramble gets faster every restart.

/// more:


- user friendly step-by step guide for solution (this might take a while - includes the actual solving algorithm)
- manual cube initial state entry as input for the hint solution guide. (includes valid cube state check)
- create a prototype for detecting colors on one side of a cube from an image.
- if image prototype works, implement video feed cube scanner as initial cube state input
- adding facebook api and friends high scores.
- other credentials related stuff: sql injection tests, password change, password recovery, add email, other tab logout, login attempts, etc.





optional:
- Make mobile friendly?
