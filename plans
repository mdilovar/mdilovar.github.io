done so far (current commit):
-- started working on the mouse rotation in event controls

current task:
- add mouse movement support (counterclockwise should work too; for n>3 - all middle layers should rotate.)

next up:





/// more:


- user friendly step-by step guide for solution (this might take a while - includes the actual solving algorithm)
- manual cube initial state entry as input for the hint solution guide. (includes valid cube state check)
- create a prototype for detecting colors on one side of a cube from an image.
- if image prototype works, implement video feed cube scanner as initial cube state input
- adding facebook api and friends high scores.
- other credentials related stuff: successful registration ui feedback, sql injection tests, password change, password recovery, add email, other tab logout, login attempts, etc.
