done so far (current commit):


current tasks:
- adding facebook api and friends' high scores.
- other credentials related stuff: sql injection tests, password change, password recovery, add email, other tab logout, login attempts, etc.


next up:
solving algorithm
    steps:
    choosing top color - user vs automatic vs fixed - white? /for now fixed - white/
    check how far solved and skip steps in necessary / later /
    build correctly oriented cross
    build corners
    build 2n'd layer edges
    build 3rd layer cross
    correct the 3rd layer cross
    place 3rd layer corners
    rotate 3rd layer corners

/// more:


- user friendly step-by step guide for solution (this might take a while - includes the actual solving algorithm)
- manual cube initial state entry as input for the hint solution guide. (includes valid cube state check)
- create a prototype for detecting colors on one side of a cube from an image.
- if image prototype works, implement video feed cube scanner as initial cube state input






optional:
- Make mobile friendly?
- rotationrequest queue actually ony works with one request at a time now. If there is ever a need for a real queue,
  // the getLayer function should be moved to inside the rotate function
