current task:
use T key to rotate the cube's top. when t is pressed the cube object returns a group of the cubicles to the eventhandler which then rotates it.then move this to a public rotate function of the cube that is called from the event handler with the key pressed.

Before Monday do:
-finish up the cube 
-add game ui elements (Hi Sc, time, etc) and add server side score-keeping
-create a prototype for detecting colors on one side of a cube from an image.
-if time, adding facebook api

Next up:
- if image prototype works, implement video feed cube scanner
- and/or alternative manual cube status selection with center color picker
- automatic solution
- user friendly step-by step guide for solution
 

optional: 
- Make mobile friendly?
- Continue Python develop the cube,  maybe start switching to JS  already  - (quick test the evo algorithm)
