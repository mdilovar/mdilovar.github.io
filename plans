done so far (current commit):
// timer now fires after first move, not after scrambling is over (added a callback for rotation requests; scramble now uses this callback recursivesly instead of a timeinterval.) // added ui feedback during scrambling ('scrambling...')// incresed scramble speed, after completion rotation speed is set back to normal // the draw function was called everytime a cube was inited, which caused ever-faster animations every reset - fixed this. // added touch cube controls

current task:



next up:


/// more:


- user friendly step-by step guide for solution (this might take a while - includes the actual solving algorithm)
- manual cube initial state entry as input for the hint solution guide. (includes valid cube state check)
- create a prototype for detecting colors on one side of a cube from an image.
- if image prototype works, implement video feed cube scanner as initial cube state input
- adding facebook api and friends high scores.
- other credentials related stuff: sql injection tests, password change, password recovery, add email, other tab logout, login attempts, etc.





optional:
- Make mobile friendly?
- rotationrequest queue actually ony works with one request at a time now. If there is ever a need for a real queue,
  // the getLayer function should be moved to inside the rotate function
