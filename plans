- user friendly step-by step guide for solution {Before even given cube status input, just like hints. input is the scrambled cube.}

- create a prototype for detecting colors on one side of a cube from an image.
- adding facebook api and friends high scores.
- if image prototype works, implement video feed cube scanner
- and/or alternative manual cube status selection with center color picker
