done so far (current commit):
aded - move history and undo(n) method for rewinding. // made somechanges to rotateface method's argument list // started working on SolutionGuide class - so far has two methods: higlightCublets(cublets,color) and attenuateCublets(cublets)

current task:
solving algorithm
 - how do I do this? - optimal vs know intuitive algorithms


next up:


/// more:


- user friendly step-by step guide for solution (this might take a while - includes the actual solving algorithm)
- manual cube initial state entry as input for the hint solution guide. (includes valid cube state check)
- create a prototype for detecting colors on one side of a cube from an image.
- if image prototype works, implement video feed cube scanner as initial cube state input
- adding facebook api and friends' high scores.
- other credentials related stuff: sql injection tests, password change, password recovery, add email, other tab logout, login attempts, etc.





optional:
- Make mobile friendly?
- rotationrequest queue actually ony works with one request at a time now. If there is ever a need for a real queue,
  // the getLayer function should be moved to inside the rotate function
