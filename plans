current task:
added rotation for middle layer(s) for now keys just move middle layers of 3x3x3, (task was: finish the cube already (just movements))
    but the actual functions accept middleSliceNumber argument. 
    So this will work for larger cubes too. just need to add the keys for that. Maybe don't bother for now, and do this when adding mouse move control.
removed the middle invisible cubes while not affecting the matrix update algorithms. (by inserting emptry unrendered Object3Ds).
PREVIOUS SUBMISSION - but still this week. removed the coloring of the inside of the cube.
tidied stuff up a bit more by modifyinf the update func of the cube class to utilize "animation requests"

/// more complete:
Before Monday try to do at least some of:
- add NxNxN fixes later. for now don't waste too much time, instead focus on a 3x3x3 mvp



- add cube tracking and game ui elements (Hi Sc, time, etc)
- add mouse face/middle movement on top of key movement - (nxnxn, n>3 will have more than 1 middle layer) 
- add server side score-keeping
- create a prototype for detecting colors on one side of a cube from an image.
- adding facebook api










Next up:
- if image prototype works, implement video feed cube scanner
- and/or alternative manual cube status selection with center color picker
- automatic solution
- user friendly step-by step guide for solution
 

optional: 
- Make mobile friendly?
- Continue Python develop the cube,  maybe start switching to JS  already  - (quick test the evo algorithm)
